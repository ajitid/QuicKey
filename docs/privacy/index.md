# *QuicKey* Privacy Policy

When first installed, *QuicKey* asks for these permissions:

- [*Read and change your browsing history on all signed-in devices*](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/sessions)

    *QuicKey* uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of the open tabs, as well as pages from your history. The *"all signed-in devices"* part is there only so that recently closed tabs can be restored with their full history. The only time *QuicKey* changes your browsing history is when you choose to delete a history item.

- [*Read and change your bookmarks*](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/bookmarks)

    *QuicKey* uses this permission to let you search the titles and URLs of your bookmarked pages. The only time it changes your bookmarks is when you choose to delete one.

*QuicKey* does not request the *Read and modify all your data on all websites you visit* permission that many extensions require, so it can't read or modify the content of any pages you visit. It doesn't transmit any information other than some anonymized diagnostic data. It never sends anything about the pages you visit. 

If you right-click the *QuicKey* icon on the toolbar, there's a message saying *Can't read or change site's data*, which is a bit misleading, since it can't read or change *any* site's data, not just the current one.

The complete *QuicKey* source code is available for inspection on [GitHub](https://github.com/fwextensions/QuicKey).
